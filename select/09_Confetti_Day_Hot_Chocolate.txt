Grandma in the church sleeping
Ma was in the church weeping
Daddy was ready to give his daughter away

Antie Claire said to Antie Mary how have you been keeping?
I haven't seen you since grandpa passed away

Confetti day think about what you're doing
Confetti day debit[?] myself to wreck and ruin

When the preacher said say I do
I looked at you and I knew what I was doing was right
I said when the preacher said say I do Jean
I looked at you and I knew what I was doing was right

Night before I couldn't sleep
Thinking bout the vows i had to keep
For better worse for ever more
Standing at the altar
My heart beating faster man
If I were a bird I'd fly straight through the door

Confetti day can you think about what you're doing
Confetti day debit[?] myself to wreck and ruin

But when the preacher said say I do
I looked at you and I knew what I was doing was right
I said when the preacher said say I do
I looked at you babe I knew what I was doing was right
