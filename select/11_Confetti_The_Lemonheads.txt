He kinda shoulda sorta woulda loved her, if he could've
The story's getting closer to the end
He kinda shoulda sorta woulda loved her, if he could've
He'd rather be alone than pretend

She just wanted him to love her, but he didn't
He took to the woods and wandered in it
Walked along and on, until they couldn't
Just told himself to tell her that he wouldn't

He kinda shoulda sorta woulda loved her, if he could've
The story's getting closer to the end
He kinda shoulda sorta woulda loved her, if he could've
He'd rather be alone than pretend

She'd wanted him to love her, but he didn't
He took to the woods and wandered in it
Walked along and on, 'til his legs couldn't
Stole her voice, to tell her that he wouldn't

He kinda shoulda sorta woulda loved her, if he could've
The story's getting closer to the end
He kinda shoulda sorta woulda loved her, if he could've
He'd rather be alone than pretend
Hell

Yeah, he kinda shoulda sorta woulda loved her, if he could've
The story's getting closer to the end
He kinda shoulda sorta woulda loved her, if he could've
He'd rather be alone than pretend
