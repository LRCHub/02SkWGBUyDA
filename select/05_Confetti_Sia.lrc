[00:11.89] We had love so strong my heart couldn't take it
[00:17.61] You took it in your hands and resuscitated
[00:23.33] You said, "Me and you against the world"
[00:26.17] You said, "You and me forever, girl"
[00:29.15] I felt every cell fall in love with you, but
[00:51.15] 
[00:35.33] I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
[00:41.32] You on your phone, your laptop and your PlayStation
[00:47.18] I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
[00:52.69] But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later
[01:24.19] 
[00:58.70] No, I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
[01:04.63] No, I won't stand for it, no, I don't need confetti
[01:10.66] And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
[01:16.86] I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
[01:22.79] I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
[01:28.32] I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
[01:56.32] 
[01:37.78] You hurt my pride, part of me died, but all of that's ego
[01:43.48] And the house we lived in had no doors, and it had no windows
[01:49.36] You said, "I'm hangin' with the boys"
[01:52.13] You said, "Workin' late to pay our bills"
[01:55.13] But I found lipstick on your collar, wasn't my color
[02:21.13] 
[02:01.54] I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
[02:06.97] You on your phone, your laptop and your PlayStation
[02:13.05] I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
[02:18.79] But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later
[02:50.29] 
[02:24.88] No, I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
[02:30.63] No, I won't stand for it, no, I don't need confetti
[02:36.76] And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
[02:42.50] I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
[02:48.67] I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
[03:16.67] 
[02:54.48] No, I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
[03:00.31] No, I won't stand for it, no, I don't need confetti
[03:06.47] And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
[03:12.20] I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
[03:18.25] I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
[03:24.04] I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
[03:30.05] I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
[03:58.05] 
[03:35.97] I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
[03:41.87] I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
[03:47.84] I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
[03:53.77] I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
